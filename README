A Maven archetype to generate quickly a CoffeeScript project with unit tests.

Usage:
mvn clean install

Then change the current directory to the directory where you want to create the project, and type:
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local

You should see all your local archetypes listed, and the last entry should be similar to the next line:
12: local -> coffeescript-basic-archetype (coffeescript-basic-archetype)

Select the appropiate number for "coffeescript-basic-archetype" following the wizard to create a new project.

When ready, go inside the newly created project and type:
mvn clean install

And that's it.
